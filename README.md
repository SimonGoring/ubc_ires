## From technical challenges to interdisciplinary success: Understanding interactions between climate, vegetation and land use change

A presentation using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) to document work I've done to address issues of climate change and data availability.  The talk covers major challenges in undertaking effective interdisciplinary research.  Using case studies from my own work I show how an integrated approach to data management can provide useful insights across disciplines and improve our understanding of the ways that recent ecological change followng Euro-American settlement of North America may bias our understanding of ecological processes.
